# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline for Flask Application using GitHub Actions

This project sets up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Flask application using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automatically tests, merges, and deploys code to an EC2 instance whenever changes are pushed to the `dev` branch.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── deploy.yml         # GitHub Actions workflow for testing and deploying
├── app.py                      # Flask application code
└── tests.py                    # Test cases for the Flask application
```

## 🔧 Workflow Overview

### 1. Testing

When changes are pushed to the `dev` branch, the following steps occur:
- **Checkout Code**: The code from the `dev` branch is checked out.
- **Set Up Python**: The Python environment is set up using the specified version.
- **Install Dependencies**: Required dependencies, including Flask, Pytest, and Requests, are installed.
- **Run Tests**: The test cases are executed against the Flask application.

### 2. Merging

If all tests pass:
- The code is merged into the `main` branch using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication.

### 3. Deployment

After merging:
- The application is deployed to an AWS EC2 instance with the following steps:
  - **Checkout Main Branch**: The code from the `main` branch is checked out.
  - **Deploy to EC2**: The application code is copied to the EC2 instance, where the environment is set up and the Flask application is started using Gunicorn.

## 🌐 GitHub Actions Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Here’s a brief look at its configuration:

```yaml
name: Test, Merge, and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev

jobs:
  test_and_merge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      ...
      
  deploy_to_ec2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test_and_merge
    steps:
      ...
```

## 📦 Prerequisites

- **AWS EC2 Instance**: Ensure you have an EC2 instance running, and SSH access is configured.
- **GitHub Repository**: This project should be hosted on GitHub.

## 🔑 Secrets Configuration

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `EC2_HOST`: The public IP or hostname of your EC2 instance.
- `EC2_USER`: The username for SSH access (e.g., `ec2-user`).
- `EC2_SSH_KEY`: The private SSH key used to access the EC2 instance.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions, used for merging branches.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devops-bharat05/GithubAction_myapp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd GithubAction_myapp
   ```

3. Make changes to `app.py` or `tests.py`, then push to the `dev` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update app and tests"
   git push origin dev
   ```

4. Monitor the GitHub Actions tab in your repository to see the workflow in action!
